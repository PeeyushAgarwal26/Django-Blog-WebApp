# 📝 Blog Web Application - Django Project

This is a simple and functional Blog Web Application built using the **Django** web framework, that allows users to Register, Log in or Log out and Create, Edit or Delete their blog posts. The project focuses on implementing essential web application functionality using Django's built-in features like authentication, models, and form handling. It also uses views, templates, and routing for smooth user interaction. It's a great starting point for learning full-stack development with Django.
